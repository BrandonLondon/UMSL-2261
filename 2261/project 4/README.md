**CS2261 Object-Oriented Programming Spring 2019**

**Project #4 [85 points]**

---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Due date is Monday, 04/15. Submit either &#39;script&#39; files or screenshots that will show your source code, results of compilation and execution. Also, submit UML diagrams for both parts of the project in a separate file.

Please, follow the proper programming style and include necessary comments.

1. [45 points] Exercise # 11.2, p. 447 (_The_ _Person __,_ _Student__ ,_ _Employee__,_ _Faculty_ _and_ _Staff_ _classes_). Note that in the output you have to show how the overridden method toString works for an object of each class. Also, though it is not required to provide the output with testing all methods, I will check whether you implemented all required methods.

1. [40 points] Exercise 13.9, p. 536 (_Enable_ _Circle_ _comparable_). Override the following methods: compareTo (interface Comparable), toString (class GeometricObject) and equals (class Object).Create an array of comparable circles, sort them and display the result of a sorting procedure. Then create one more circle, which is equal to one of the existing circles and demonstrate the work of the method equals.
